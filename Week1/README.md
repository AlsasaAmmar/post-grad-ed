# Postgrad Practice Week 1

## Agenda

1. JavaScript Cardio I
2. Algorithms I
3. Developer skills: Code reviews
4. Technical Assignment I
5. Questionnaire I

### 1. JavaScript Cardio I

In order to become good at using a programming language, it's important to know the syntax. The various versions. And the different ways these can be used to write useful programs.

In this section you'll get several exercises you can do to train your ability to use the language of JavaScript:

- [JavaScript Array Cardio Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB1ZC7czKRs)
- [.some(), .every(), .find() and [...SPREADS] â€” Array Cardio Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmRfyNg1lw)

### 2. Algorithms I

Thinking algorithmically is an essential part of a developer's mental toolkit. But what is an algorithm?

> An algorithm is a specific set of steps that can be used to solve a (coding) problem.

From this we can infer that `thinking algorithmically` refers to **the ability of thinking in steps**. Applied to programming, it means:

- Splitting a problem up into smaller problems to solve easily.
- Translating the steps into code

You might think, "easier said than done!", and you are right. That's why we practice.

In the following links you'll find several exercises to practice your algorithmic thinking skills! Do at least 5 of them.

### 3. Developer skills: Planning your project

Before starting any project, the first step is to **make a plan**. Doing this for a web application takes a specific process. Learn more about that here:

- [Starting A Serious Web Development Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGGPTskb7c8)
- [The Creation of a Web Application](https://selftaughtcoders.com/creation-of-a-web-application/)

### 4. Technical Assignment I

When applying for jobs a company most likely will give you a technical assignment to do. Why? They want to test your skills.

In this bi-weekly assignment, you're asked to pick a technical assignment from [this list](./../technical-assignments/README.md) and work on it for two weeks. Doing this will help you become familiar with the process and give you a sense of what companies are expecting you to be able to do.

Follow the instructions:

- Pick a technical assignment that's challenging enough for you to spend 2 weeks on (ask your mentor for help if needed)
- Make a plan of action of how you're goign to approach this assignment (use the aforementioned resources)
- Work on this assignment for two weeks. **Deadline is next week Saturday 23.59 CET.**
- Discuss with your classmate whenever you're stuck

One tip before you start: imagine doing this for a real company. Because that's the only way you'll train yourself to take it seriously. (And maybe it will even lead to opportunities...)

### 5. Questionnaire I

Every week you'll be doing a questionnaire. These contain questions that are meant to challenge you and help make explicit what you want out of your career.

The more you think about this and become aware of what you want, the better you'll do in an interview!

The key is to be as honest and elaborate as possible. This means: take all the time you need to answer the questions.

The theme of this week is: "Why do I want to be a software developer"?

### Finished?

At the end of this week you need to deliver upon the following in the Slack channel [#postgraduationpack](https://hackyourfuture.slack.com/archives/C010LE1F9U7):

1. A video explaining 1 concept you've learned about most about during the development of the project you're working on. Post the video in the Slack channel

Here are the requirements you have to fulfill:

- A general high level explanation of the concept: how + why
- A self-written code example that you analyse and explain step-by-step
- The video should include both your screen and your webcam view (we want to see your face!)
- It should be around 5 minutes

2. Write out in 100 words or less your number #1 key lesson you learned this week. Post the message in the message in the Slack channel

> Don't make it generic, like "I learned that it's important to always keep learning". Instead, make it specific to your learning process. For example, "I learned that authentication is needed to safeguard certain routes from public access".

3. Already make a pull request with including the current state of your technical assigment code.

4. Perform a code review on the pull request of one of your classmates. For instructions on how to do this, look [here](./../how-to-code-review.md)
