# Postgrad Practice Week 2

## Agenda

1. JavaScript Cardio II
2. Algorithms II
3. Technical Assignment I

### 1. JavaScript Cardio

We'll continue with more JavaScript Cardio. You'll be doing several algorithm challenges. Code along with the instructor and play around with the solutions.

### 2. Algorithms II

Let's continue with more algorithm challenges. Like last week, try to solve at least 5 of them.

Do research, try to think step-by-step. And always remember that there are multiple solutions to the same problem.

### 3. Technical Assignment I

Continue with the technical assignment. Have you gained any new insights so far? Write them down! You want to keep track of these, as it will help you retain what you're learning.

To help you during the process, here are a list of questions you can keep in mind to accelerate learning:

-   Why is this (not) working?
-   How does this concept relate to that concept?
-   Am I able to articulate what's happening?
-   How is this application different/similar to my previous project?

Make sure you keep your remote repository up to date. Commit regularly!

And like previous weeks, make a video explaining one concept you've learned most about during the development of this project. Post the video in the Slack channel!

### Finished?

At the end of this week you need to deliver upon the following in the Slack channel [#postgraduationpack](https://hackyourfuture.slack.com/archives/C010LE1F9U7):

1. A video explaining 1 concept you've learned about most about during the development of the project you're working on. Post the video in the Slack channel

Here are the requirements you have to fulfill:

-   A general high level explanation of the concept: how + why
-   A self-written code example that you analyse and explain step-by-step
-   The video should include both your screen and your webcam view (we want to see your face!)
-   It should be around 5 minutes

2. Write out in 100 words or less your number #1 key lesson you learned this week. Post the message in the Slack channel

> Don't make it generic, like "I learned that it's important to always keep learning". Instead, make it specific to your learning process. For example, "I learned that authentication is needed to safeguard certain routes from public access".

3. Submit your technical assignment from week 1 as a pull request to the repository. Post the URL in the Slack channel
