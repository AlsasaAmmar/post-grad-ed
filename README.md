# Post Graduation Education

![Postgrad](postgrad.png)

Dear alumnus, congratulations on finishing the HackYourFuture 7 month program!

In this repository you'll find a curriculum that helps you prepare yourself for a job.

These are the skills you're going to work on:

**TECHNICAL**

- Web Application development
- Algorithmic thinking

**COMMUNICATION**

- Explaining technical concepts
- English fluency
- Confidence

**MINDSET**

- Self-reflection
- Ambition

Each week you'll do exercises in order to strengthen all these skills:

- **JavaScript cardio**: In these exercises you'll become more familiar with various JavaScript methods and practice with them. You'll watch videos and code along
- **Algorithms**: In these exercises you'll practice your ability to think in steps, by doing programming challenges
- **Technical assignments**: This is the bulk of this module. You'll prepare for the job interview process, by making _real_ technical assignments that come from _real_ companies.
- **Questionnaire**: every week you'll receive a questionnaire containing questions that will challenge you to think about what you want out of your career. This will help you become more fluent and confident in presenting yourself in a job interview.

In the final week you are asked to record a "video job application". This will be the your test to see to what degree you are able to present yourself professionally and confidently.

> This module is designed to be used alongside the [Getting your first job/internship guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E9WMuH_razDA29uQ76hYRgVx0JBPGaXROioi1YiDmn0/edit?usp=sharing). Consider this the reading material to be used to keep your eye on the prize: a paid web developer job.

## Mentorship & accountability

In this module you'll be paired up with a mentor, an established senior developer that will guide you along in the process of preparing for a job. Each Sunday you'll check in with them to share your learnings and get feedback. Depending on their availability they can also provide help (remotely) during the week.

In addition, you should also keep yourself accountable by communicating with other classmates. That's not always that easy. Therefore, HackYourFuture has created a special channel on Slack that you can use in order to discuss, ask for help and keep your motivation. It's called [#postgraduationpack](https://hackyourfuture.slack.com/archives/C010LE1F9U7).

## Planning

| Week | Topic                                                                               | Homework                        |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1.   | JavaScript Cardio I, Algorithms I, Technical Assignment I                           | [Practice W1](/Week1/README.md) |
| 2.   | JavaScript Cardio II, Algorithms II, Technical Assignment I                         | [Practice W2](/Week2/README.md) |
| 3.   | JavaScript Cardio III, Algorithms III, Technical Assignment II                      | [Practice W3](/Week3/README.md) |
| 4.   | JavaScript Cardio IV, Algorithms IV, Technical Assignment II, Video Job Application | [Practice W4](/Week4/README.md) |

## Finished?

Have you been through all the 4 weeks? You're amazing!

It's important to know that the goal of this module is NOT to go through it and finish "knowing" how to do all these things. Working on these things is a never-ending process.

Instead, your goal should be to become familiar with these topics and always keep on learning. That way getting a job will be a natural consequence of your efforts.

However, before we actually go on and apply for jobs we need to do a final check...
