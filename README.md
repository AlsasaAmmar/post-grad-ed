# Post Graduation Education

![Postgrad](postgrad.png)

Dear alumnus, congratulations on finishing the HackYourFuture 7 month program!

In this repository youâ€™ll find outlined a post graduation education curriculum. It's **optional** and serves as a structure for you to use whenever you want to prepare yourself for a job.

Here's what you'll work on:

**TECHNICAL**

-   Web Application development
-   Algorithmic thinking

**COMMUNICATION**

-   Explaining technical concepts
-   English fluency
-   Confidence & mindset

Each week you'll do exercises in order to strengthen all these skills. You'll also practice solidifying the fundamentals of web development:

```md
-   JavaScript fundamentals (basic syntax, event loop, OOP)
-   Form validation
-   HTTP
-   Synchronous versus asynchronous
-   Authentication & authorization
-   Client-server model
-   The role of JSON (parse, stringify)
-   API routing/client-side routing
-   Database modeling
-   Frontend state management
-   Code modularization
-   Working with external services/APIs
```

Ideally, in 4 weeks you should be very clear about what each of these concept mean and what their role is in application development.

Additionally, every week you'll receive a **questionnaire** containing questions that will challenge you to think about what you want out of your career. This will help you become more fluent and confident in presenting yourself in a job interview.

## How to use this repository

This module is designed to be used alongside the [Getting your first job/internship guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E9WMuH_razDA29uQ76hYRgVx0JBPGaXROioi1YiDmn0/edit?usp=sharing). Consider this the reading material to be used to keep your eye on the prize: a paid web developer job.

## Mentorship & accountability

In order to stay motivated it's good to hold yourself accountable. That's not always that easy. Therefore, HackYourFuture has created a special channel on Slack that you can use in order to discuss, ask for help and keep your motivation. It's called [#postgraduationpack](https://hackyourfuture.slack.com/archives/C010LE1F9U7).

In addition we'll arrange for a mentor to supervise your learning. Each Sunday you'll check in with them to share your learnings and get feedback. 

## Planning

| Week | Topic                                                          | Homework                        |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1.   | JavaScript Cardio I, Algorithms I, Technical Assignment I      | [Practice W1](/Week1/README.md) |
| 2.   | JavaScript Cardio II, Algorithms II, Technical Assignment I    | [Practice W2](/Week2/README.md) |
| 3.   | JavaScript Cardio III, Algorithms III, Technical Assignment II | [Practice W3](/Week3/README.md) |
| 4.   | JavaScript Cardio IV, Algorithms IV, Technical Assignment II   | [Practice W4](/Week4/README.md) |

## Goal of the module

The goal of this curriculum is NOT to go through it and finish "knowing" how to do all these things. Working on these things is a never-ending process.

Instead, your goal should be to become familiar with these topics and always keep on learning. That way getting a job will be a natural consequence of your efforts.

That said, that means there's no "finishing" this module. After the 4 weeks you can go back and restart again. The structure can be used over and over, while YOU can change the content. We've provided some suggestions, but if you have any other resources to use then do so!

Good luck and have fun!

## Finished?

Have you been through all the 4 weeks? You're amazing! Now all that's left is to find a job.

However, before you apply there's a final thing to do...
