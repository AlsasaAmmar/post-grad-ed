# How to record a concept

As a developer it's important to be able to articulate what you know. This is important because:

1. Allows you to more effectively communicate with colleagues
2. Helps you understand what you're doing more deeply

In this weekly exercise you'll record a video in which you explain a programming concept you recently learned, in order to become better at the aforementioned points.

We recommend using the following software: https://obsproject.com/
Here's a tutorial to learn how to set it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL8BwstqiqE

Here are the requirements the video has to fulfill:

- A general high level explanation of the concept: how + why

  > This will give the viewer a clear summary of what you're talking about and its relevance.

- A self-written code example that you analyse and explain step-by-step

  > This will provide a concrete example, that you dissect line by line

- The video should include both your screen and your webcam view (we want to see your face!)

  > This makes the video more personal and more easily understandable

- It should be around 5 minutes

  > This will help you keep things simple and concise

Good luck!
